                  Animal Farm is a simulation that uses AI steering behaviors
                  model to imitate the farm animals' movements.

    <p>
      This project was a fun and challenging project for me where I had the opportunity to put into practice what I learned about <strong>Autonomous Agents</strong>
      in games and animation, focusing on math and physics (mainly Vectors) and how to apply their principles to model and simulate complex behaviors through programming.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had decided to make a simple farm simulation with low poly assets, where the player character is a farmer and the AI agents are animals. Through this
      simple world I could focus on giving the animals agents the ability to navigate around their world in a life-like and improvisational manner.

<!--World Settings-->
<div class="subPara">
  <h2 class="heading"> World Settings</h2>
   <div class="text">
    <p>
       The simulation world consists of grass, barn, sun, water troughs, mud puddle, fence, seeds and Sun.<br>
       <strong>The player character</strong> is a farmer that can be controlled by arrow keys to move around.<br>
       <strong> AI agents</strong> are the animals : cows, sheep, pigs and chickens all of which use NavMesh Agent component attached to them.
    </p>
    <p>
       After setting up the scene and characters, I started by adding colliders to props, player character and AI agents.
       Then I added a <strong>navigation map</strong> to the grass game object and baked it to the scene as it'd be the surface the agents will navigate on.
       I decided to add <strong>Navmesh obstacle</strong> component to the game objects shown in image below ( barn, water troughs, mud puddle, fence, seeds).
       Navmesh obstacle is usually used for moving objects, but I wanted to experiment using it for static objects to observe the difference 
       between using colliders alone verses using colliders with Navmesh obstacle.

<!--Animation-->
<div class="subPara">
  <h2 class="heading">Animation</h2>
   <div class="text">
    <p>
      The animation for the player was a simple system, where the character moves based on the player's vertical and horizontal axes input.<br>
      The four legged animals agents were not animated using unity animation system, but rather using vectors. Each leg is treated as a separate
      game object and is then rotated halfway through using Lerp function during the walk animation. <br>
      All the four legged agents call the Animate script which has two states: walking or not walking, based on which state the agent is in,
      the script either animate the animal or not.
    </p>


<!--Cows subsection-->
<div class="subPara">
  <h2 class="heading"> Cows Agents</h2>
   <div class="text">
    <p>
       There are two cows agents in the environment, each has two states : <i>wander and seek.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
       <strong> Wander </strong> is the idle state in which the cow agent moves around the farm (navmesh map) with no definite goal location.<br>
       Wander behavior was implemented here by constraining the cow agent to the surface of a sphere located slightly ahead of it.
       The sphere has a target location positioned on its circumference that moves back and forth around the sphere within a random range.
       As it moves the cow agent update its goal location, this random displacement makes the cow agent behavior look realistic without it looking
       twitchy and produces sustained turns.
       
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong> Seek </strong> is the state in which the cow seeks the large water trough.<br>
      Seek behavior is simply the pursue of a static target, it was implemented using navmesh agent set destination method with a stopping distance 
      to prevent the cow from continuously arriving to the target,stepping back and then approach it again.<br>
      I made the seek behavior evoke randomly if the cow is within a certain distance from the water trough to make the cow agent looks like
      its going to water trough only if its thirsty.
